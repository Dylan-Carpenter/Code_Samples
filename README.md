# School Projects
Author: Dylan Carpenter

This repository contains selections of code/projects from my time at Western Washington University.
The projects are split up into separate directories each containing their own respective README files detailing them further.

The samples are as follows:

  - "Baby_Name_Program" (Completed as part of Data Structures course): Program uses an input file, reads it, stores it in various data structures, and allows the user to perform various operations. CODED IN JAVA
  
  - "Mini_Shell" (Completed as part of Unix Software Development course): Paired down shell for the Unix operating system (similar to bash). Includes functionality such as built in functions, pipelines, file redirection, and more. CODED IN C
